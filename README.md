Refactored original visual basic macro AllStocksAnalysis()
The original macro made a pass through entire dataset for each ticker symbol to calculate year return. 
The refactored version makes a single pass through the dataset to calculate this return for all ticker symbols.
In the future additional ticker symbols can be added by redimensioning four arrays below the comment "'Initialize an array of all tickers".
